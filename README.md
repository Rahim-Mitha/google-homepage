This is my first project on my journey to learn code. I am motivated to learn code so I can develop a new skillset as well as prove to myself I can do it. 

Self learning and online education is something new to me as I have always been used to a class room setting thus far. I will be going through The Odin Project to complete my goal of learning to code.
